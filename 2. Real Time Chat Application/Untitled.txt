Detailed Report: Chat Application
Overview
This is a real-time chat application built with a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend using Socket.IO for real-time communication. The application supports multiple chat rooms, user presence tracking, typing indicators, emoji support, and message history persistence.

Architecture
Frontend (Client)
Framework: React with Vite build tool
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO client
Styling: CSS with Google Fonts
Additional Libraries:
emoji-picker-react for emoji support
React hooks for state management
Backend (Server)
Framework: Node.js with Express
Real-time Communication: Socket.IO
Database: lowdb (JSON-based database)
CORS: Enabled for cross-origin requests
Middleware: Custom error handling
Key Features
1. User Authentication & Room Joining
Users can enter a username and room name to join chat rooms
Simple login interface with validation
Support for multiple concurrent chat rooms
2. Real-time Messaging
Instant message delivery using Socket.IO
Distinct styling for own messages vs. others' messages
Timestamps for all messages
Message history persistence per room
3. User Presence
Online users list displayed in sidebar
Automatic user registration when joining a room
User removal when disconnecting
4. Typing Indicators
Shows when another user is typing a message
Timeout-based indicator clearing
5. Emoji Support
Built-in emoji picker
Easy emoji insertion into messages
6. Message History
Persistent storage of chat history using lowdb
Room-specific message retrieval
Automatic loading of history when joining a room
Technical Implementation
Frontend Components
App.jsx: Main application component handling state and Socket.IO events
App.css: Complete styling for all UI elements
State Management: React hooks for managing messages, users, typing status, etc.
Backend Components
index.js: Main server file with Express app and Socket.IO setup
middleware.js: Error handling middleware
db.json: Persistent storage for chat history and user data
Socket.IO Events
Client to Server:
join_room: User joins a chat room
send_message: User sends a message
typing: User is typing a message
Server to Client:
chat_history: Initial message history for a room
receive_message: New message from another user
user_list: Updated list of online users
typing: Notification that a user is typing
Data Storage
Database: lowdb (lightweight JSON database)
Storage Structure:
chatHistory: Object with room IDs as keys containing message arrays
users: Object with socket IDs as keys containing user information
Security Considerations
CORS configuration for controlled access
Basic input validation
Room-based isolation of chat data
Potential Improvements
User authentication system
Message encryption for privacy
File/image sharing capability
Message editing/deletion features
Notification system
User profile management
Database migration to more robust solution (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
Running the Application
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your system
Running the Server
Navigate to the server directory:

cd server
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start the server:

npm start
The server will run on port 3001 by default.
Running the Client
Navigate to the client directory:

cd client
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start the development server:

npm run dev
The client will typically run on port 5173.
Running Both Client and Server Together
For development, you'll need to run both the client and server simultaneously in separate terminal windows.
