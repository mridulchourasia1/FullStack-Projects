## 📝 About This Repository

This repository contains two major projects, each with its own dedicated folder and detailed README. They represent significant milestones in my development journey, showcasing my expertise in front-end and back-end integration, real-time communication, and complex UI/UX design.

### How Projects Are Organized
- Each project resides in its own folder within this main repository.
- Every project has its own README.md providing detailed information, setup instructions, features, and technologies used.
- The projects are related in the sense that they both emphasize real-time features and full-stack development, but each serves a different purpose.
